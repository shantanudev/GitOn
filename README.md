CS 467 Social Visualization Project
---------------------------------------------

Analyzes a given GitHub repository for the number of replies and activity related to a certain issue. 

Creates a refined visualization that plots the number of comments by user on a give day.

## Web application

For the web application, we are using http://visjs.org/ to help us to do the visualization. We mainly write the code, which is in the js/controller.js file, to fetch and process data. 

The demo can be find at http://xuefeng-zhu.github.io/GitOn/ 
The way to use the web application is very simple. You can provide User name and Reposity name, and then press the button "Visualization". 

If you want to run the application offline, just go to the application folder in terminal and then run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" Then visit localhost:8000
